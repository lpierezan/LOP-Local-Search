Implementation (and analysis) of a Local Search for the Linear Ordering Problem.
It started as a project for the postgraduate Metaheuristics course at Puc-Rio in 04/2016.

The local search algorithm is based on the papers:

[1] Efficient local search algorithms for the linear ordering problem
Celso S. Sakuraba and Mutsunori Yagiura
and
[2] The Linear Ordering Problem: Instances, Search Space Analysis and Algorithms.
TOMMASO SCHIAVINOTTO and THOMAS STÃœTZLE

A Treap with implicity key representation was implemented as alternative to [1] data structures.
The Local Search statistics and analysis are the main results of the project.
